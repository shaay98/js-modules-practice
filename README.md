## Exporting / Importing Description:
Export one function from one JS file, then import that same functions into another JS file using the Export / Import keywords. Be sure to add ./ and or .js to file names once imported. (May be done with autocomplete.)
Console.log function name and values if required to call the function once imported.
Use terminal "node (FILE NAME)"
